# Data Types
- tells how much storage/ memory is to be allocated to a variable

## Primary
- int 
	 - memory size 
	   ```c 
	   printf("%lu",sizeof(int)); // 4 bytes in most of the computers
	   ```
	 - short int -> 1 byte
	 - long int -> 4 bytes
	  - int for 16 bit -> 
		 -  signed -> -32768 to 32747  (default)
		 -   unsigned -> 0 to 65535
	 - int for 32 bit
		 -  
- float
	- memory size -> 1 byte or 8 bit
	- 
- char
- double
- void

## Derived
- array
- structure
- union
- pointers

## User-Defined
- type def
- enumerated
